Things I need to do:

=> Login Functionality(Works perfectly)
	
=> Personal Info
	=> Name
	=> Class
		=> Subjects Enrolled into (according the the class)
	
=> Time Table
	=> Daily Time-Table
		=> Name of Class -> Starting time of class -> Duration of class -> Class link
	=> Edit time table
		=> Though : Change the time table for the whole day
		=> Though : Option to confirm wheter the class is going to be taken or not

=> Updates
	=> Upcoming assignments for subjects enrolled in

=> Admin Privileges:
	=> Edit time table for a particular class
	=> Edit the subject list for a particular class.
	=> Add the class link for the particular class.
	=> Add the upcoming assignments for the own class.
	=> How do I grant admin privileges?

			=> already existing admins could accept/reject the request of students

				
=> Screens required in the app:
	=> Initilize 			(if someone already logged in then go to homepage with login credentials)
	=> Email-Id				(ask for the email id, check if user exists for the the given email id, if user exists then ask for password otherwise go to new-user screen)
	=> Password				(ask for theh password for the given email id and then perform the login functionality)
	=> New-user 			(ask for the name of the user, the password user wants to set, the year and the branch)
	=> Homepage				(first screen afer logging in/creating account/opening app(in case user already logged in)
